⚙️ How It Works

🕒 Animation on Load:
When the page loads, the DOMContentLoaded event in script.js applies a fade-in effect to the navbar and logo.
The fade-in CSS class controls the animation using @keyframes.
🎨 Styling:
The navbar is styled with a dark background and clean white links.
The logo is centered and given prominence to reinforce your brand identity.
🎯 Customization

🎨 Change the Logo: Replace logo.png with your custom logo. Ensure the path in index.html is correct.
⏱️ Adjust Animation Timing: Update styles.css to change the fade-in duration:
animation: fadeIn 2s ease-out forwards;
📜 Add More Sections: Expand the HTML with additional features like services, testimonials, or a contact form.
